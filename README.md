Do you want to leverage massive vectorization and high-throughput accelerators for modular synthesizers? `synthax` allows you to leverage JAX, XLA compilation and auto-vectorization/parallelization with your favorite accelerators. You can get started here üëâ [![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]()

## Basic `synthax` API Usage

```python
import jax
import synthax

# TODO
rng = jax.random.PRNGKey(42)
```

## Installation

The latest `synhtax` release can directly be installed from PyPI:

```
pip install synthax
```

If you want to get the most recent commit, please install directly from the repository:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/PapayaResearch/synthax.git@main
```

In order to use JAX on your accelerators, you can find more details in the [JAX documentation](https://github.com/google/jax#installation).
